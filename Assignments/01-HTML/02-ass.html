            Q2. This exercise helps understand the difference between inline, block,
            and inline-block display types. On an HTML page add 3 span elements each
            with the words HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Select the 3 elements using
            the span selector in an embedded style tag on the page and set the width
            to 40%.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why not?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            The elements appear in inline form. No, the width doesn't have any effect because it is an inline element.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            It does not cause any changes because span is an inline container. This is because we are trying to change
            inline element to inline itelf.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            Next, change display to block. What change does it cause?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            This makes the span appear row-wise. This is because it is now a block element. This happens because block
            takes the whole width of the screen. In block element we can also specify the width and height according to
            our need.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            Next, set display to inline-block. What change does it cause?
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            It is an inline-block element which means that we can specify the width and height according to our need
            which is not possible in inline element.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
            In conclusion, summarize the differences you noticed in the 3 behavior
            of the 3 display types. Search for other differences and jot them down
            mentally / physically! :)
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
            Inline element => In inline element all the elements are placed horizontally side by side. In this type we
            cannot change the height and width of the element.
            <br>
            <br>
            Block element => In block element all elements are stacked vertically rowwise. In this type we can change
            the height and width of the element
            <br>
            <br>
            Inline-block element => In inline-block all the elements are placed horizontally side by side but here we
            can specify the height and width of the element.
